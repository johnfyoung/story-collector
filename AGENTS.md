# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/`: App code (`main.tsx`, `App.tsx`), styles (`*.css`), and assets (`src/assets/`).
- `public/`: Static files served as-is.
- Root config: `vite.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`, `tsconfig*.json`, `index.html`.
- Build output: `dist/` (generated by `npm run build`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start Vite dev server with HMR at a local port.
- `npm run build`: Type-check (`tsc -b`) and generate production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: Serve the built app from `dist/` for a local sanity check.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint across the project.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript + React. Indentation: 2 spaces.
- Components: PascalCase file and component names (e.g., `StoryList.tsx`).
- Variables/functions: camelCase; constants UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- Hooks: start with `use` (e.g., `useStories`). Prefer named exports.
- Styles: plain CSS files alongside components (`App.css`, `index.css`).
- Linting: ESLint config in `eslint.config.js`; fix issues before PRs.

## Testing Guidelines
- No test runner is configured yet. If adding tests, prefer Vitest + React Testing Library.
- File pattern: `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`; location: co-located with source or `src/__tests__/`.
- Aim to cover component behavior and core utilities; keep tests fast and deterministic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: imperative mood and concise (e.g., "Add story fetch hook"). Optional prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` are welcome.
- PRs: include a short summary, testing steps, and screenshots for UI changes. Link related issues (e.g., `Closes #12`).
- Before opening a PR: `npm run lint` and, if applicable, run/build locally.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Environment variables: use Viteâ€™s `VITE_` prefix and a local file not committed to git (e.g., `.env.local`). Example:
  - `.env.local`: `VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com`
  - Usage: `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`
- Do not commit secrets; review diffs for accidental keys.
